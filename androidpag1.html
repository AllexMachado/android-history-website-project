                    <h3>The First Version</h3>
                    <p>The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dan+Morrill&oq=Dan+Morrill&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIMCAEQABhDGIAEGIoFMgcIAhAAGIAEMgcIAxAAGIAEMggIBBAAGBYYHjIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMggIBxAAGBYYHjIICAgQABgWGB4yCAgJEAAYFhge0gEINDUwM2owajeoAgiwAgHxBccY_fhrICHI8QXHGP34ayAhyA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Dan MorrillðŸ”—</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Inkscape&oq=Inkscape&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyFAgAEEUYORhDGIMBGLEDGIAEGIoFMg0IARAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMg0IAhAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgcIAxAAGIAEMgcIBBAAGIAEMgcIBRAAGIAEMgcIBhAAGIAEMgYIBxAFGEDSAQc1NDVqMGo5qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">InkscapeðŸ”—</a> (a free software for image vectorization) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was simply to personify the system for his team, there was no official request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

                    <h3>A New Mascot Emerges</h3>
                    <p>The idea of having a mascot started to mature, and the mission was handed over to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tLP1TeoKs8xLMsxYPTiyizKzEtUSMrJzwYAXyMH4A&q=irina+blok&oq=Irina+Blok&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEC4YgAQyBwgAEC4YgAQyDAgBEEUYORjjAhiABDIHCAIQABiABDIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQgyODM4ajBqN6gCCLACAfEFvvXeRMhkx_4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Irina BlokðŸ”—</a>, who was also a Google employee, was given the task of designing a more appealing version of the little robot.</p>

                    </picture>
                    <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with simple strokes and a flat style. The design also had to create an immediate connection with those who saw it. And so, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bugdroid&oq=Bugdroid&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORiABDIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIGCAMQABgeMgYIBBAAGB4yBggFEAAYHjIGCAYQABgeMgYIBxAAGB4yBggIEAAYHjIGCAkQABge0gEINTA5NWowajeoAgiwAgHxBRajSd09ue14&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">BugdroidðŸ”—</a>, the new Android mascot, was born.</p>

                        <img src="images/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroid">
                    </picture>
                    <p>The primary inspiration for the new Bugdroidâ€™s design came from the little stick figures used to indicate gender on restroom doors. According to legend, the artist was working at her desk in Google's office, glanced at the restroom signs, and had an instant realization: simple, clean, and direct.</p>
